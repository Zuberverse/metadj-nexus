# Documentation Archive

**Last Modified**: 2025-12-11

This archive is intentionally minimal. One‑off roadmaps, audits, and status logs live in Git history and the project `CHANGELOG.md`, not here.

## What Belongs Here

Only keep docs that remain useful as long‑term reference but are not actively maintained (e.g., a major migration rationale that still informs future work).

If a document is a point‑in‑time report or a completed workflow log, delete it after its insights are captured in active docs or the changelog.

For current documentation, start at `docs/README.md`.
